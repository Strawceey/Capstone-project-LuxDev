# Movie Dataset Exploration and Visualization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring and visualizing a movie dataset to uncover trends in movie genres, ratings, production company popularity, and box office performance. The final deliverable includes an interactive dashboard created in Power BI that allows users to explore these trends and gain insights.

## Dataset

### Source
- The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle's TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).
  
### Content
- **Columns**: Movie titles, genres, ratings, directors, release years, box office revenue, etc.
- **Purpose**: To analyze trends in the movie industry, identify popular genres and directors, and visualize the data in an interactive dashboard.

## Data Processing

1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned to remove missing values and outliers. Columns were normalized, and irrelevant data was excluded.
2. **Feature Engineering**: New features like revenue per genre and average ratings per director were calculated to enhance the analysis.
3. **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning and preparation.

## Data Analysis

### Key Insights:
- **Genre Trends**: Analysis of how movie genres have evolved over time.
- **Rating Distribution**: Distribution of movie ratings across different categories.
- **Company production Popularity**: Identification of the most prolific and highest-rated production companies.
- **Box Office Trends**: Patterns in box office performance across different years and genres.

## Dashboard Creation

### Tools Used:
- **Power BI**: The dashboard was created using Power BI to visualize the findings interactively.

### Features:
- **Revenue Trends by Genre**: A line chart showing how different genres have performed in terms of box office revenue over the years.
- **Distribution of Movie Ratings**: A bar chart illustrating the distribution of movie ratings in the dataset.
- **Most Popular Directors**: A table listing the most prolific directors based on the number of movies directed.

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. **Load the Dashboard**: Open the Power BI file included in the repository.
2. **Explore Visualizations**: Use the slicers and filters to interact with the data and explore different aspects.
3. **Interpret Results**: The visualizations help in understanding trends in movie genres, ratings, and director popularity over time.

## Installation and Setup
